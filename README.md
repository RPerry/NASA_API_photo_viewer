# Spacestagram - Shopify Front-End Developer Intern Challenge

This project is an image sharing page built with React that displays several pictures and some information about each image, as well as the ability to like an image, using NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).

To view the project locally you will need node and npm installed. After cloning down the project please run <em>npm install</em> and then <em>npm start</em>. The page can be viewed on localhost:3000 on your browser.
